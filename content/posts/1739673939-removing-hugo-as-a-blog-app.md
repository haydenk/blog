# Removing Hugo as a Blog Application

Absolutely nothing against Hugo, in fact I _love_ Hugo as a blog framework. I found myself focused too much on having the right look and meddling with themes
that I was not producing any posts.

This one will be short, I am not a wordy person. I just wanted to get my thoughts down while they were on my mind.

I will return to Hugo at some point or maybe something better than Hugo will have come around by the time I am ready to return. In the meantime, 
I will focus on creating posts within this repository.
