This weeks movie was one I that not only have I never seen but was completely anware of the movie. [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8482584)

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie comparison and peaked my interest to watch the movie in its entirety too.


### Plot
> The true story of the Mighty Mites, the football team of a Fort Worth orphanage who, during the Great Depression, went from playing without shoes, or even a football, to playing for the Texas state championships. Over the course of their winning season, these underdogs and their resilient spirit became an inspiration to their city, state, and an entire nation in need of a rebound, even catching the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Perhaps we have all felt like Hardy, an orphan, at some point. Feelings of being alone and abandoned.

1. But we need to refocus on what is happening in us and not to us.

> Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, "I will never desert you, nor will I ever abandon you,"
> 
> [Hebrews 13:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+13%3A5&version=NASB)

> For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, of our affliction which occurred in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life. Indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,
> 
> [2 Corinthians 1:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+1%3A8-9&version=NASB)

You can feel helpless and beat down but, have faith, He will deliver

> who rescued us from so great a danger of death, and will rescue us, He on whom we have set our hope. And He will yet deliver us,
> 
> [2 Corinthians 1:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+1%3A10&version=NASB)

It's not over. You are a *mighty* warrior!

2. He will delivery you!

> And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, "The Lord is with you, valiant warrior."
> 
> [Judges 6:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+1%3A10&version=NASB)

Whenever you step towards God, the enemy will increase its attacks. Much like how Coach Russell faced setbacks and accusations.

3. God will deliver through His people

> God makes a home for the lonely;
> He leads out the prisoners into prosperity,
> Only the rebellious live in parched lands.
> 
> [Psalm 68:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+68%3A6&version=NASB)

> You are not your past. You are what God says you are.
