### Storyline

> Two brothers face the fight of a lifetime - and the wreckage of their broken family - within the brutal, high-stakes world of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighting in Lionsgate's action/drama, WARRIOR. A former Marine, haunted by a tragic past, Tommy Riordan returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlists his father, a recovered alcoholic and his former coach, to train him for an MMA tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan, a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a public school teacher, returns to the amateur ring to provide for his family. Even though years have passed, recriminations and past betrayals keep Brendan bitterly estranged from both Tommy and his father. But when Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog sets him on a collision course with Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart, all the while waging the most intense, winner-takes-all battle of their lives.

Starting out in the movie we see Tommy coming back to his father criticizing his role in the family, how broken the family is, his newfound faith in the church and wondering "where was your Jesus" when his mom was hurting.

Satan does not like a functional family, he wants us broken, beaten, and separated. Like in [Genesis 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+3&version=NASB) where we see he only appears *after* the creation of the first family.

When your family is struggling, your knee jerk reation is going to be fight. That is okay, you should fight but you should be aware of who the real enemy is so that you do not fight each other.

> For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
> 
> [Ephesians 6:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+6%3A12&version=NASB)

Your family is *not* your enemy.

> When I saw their fear, I stood and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: “Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”
> 
> [Nehemiah 4:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+4%3A14&version=NASB)

Never underestimate what you can do when you are backed into a corner.

You have to fight with a forgiving heart.

> Jesus *said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy-seven times.
> 
> [Matthew 18:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+18%3A22&version=NASB)

It's okay to be hurt but not *to hurt*.

Tommy's father starts drinking again, he see's him at his lowest and actually begins to have some compassion for him.

You may *feel like* "we're lost Tommy..." and you've committed too many sins but you must fight against that.

What are you going to do? *I* am going to live in peace.

> If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.
