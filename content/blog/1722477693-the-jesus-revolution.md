I had not actually heard of this movie before this last weekend but it was actually really good. [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10098448)

I am normally skeptical of christian movies because they are either cheesy or someone trying to explain how Jesus was just a man and nothing more.

I really liked the part of the movie I saw and noticed it is available on Netflix too, so I plan on watching it.


### Storyline
> Tells the story of a young Greg Laurie (Joel Courtney) being raised by his struggling mother, Charlene (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) in the 1970s. Laurie and a sea of young people descend on sunny Southern California to redefine truth through all means of liberation. Inadvertently, Laurie meets Lonnie Frisbee (Jonathan Roumie), a charismatic hippie-street-preacher, and Pastor Chuck Smith (Kelsey Grammer) who have thrown open the doors of Smith's languishing church to a stream of wandering youth. What unfolds becomes the greatest spiritual awakening in American history. Rock and roll, newfound love, and a twist of faith lead to a JESUS REVOLUTION that turns one counterculture movement into a revival that changes the world.

> The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling to His disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?" And Jesus answered and said to them, “It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.”

The existing people in the church were upset about Chuck bringing the newcomers into the church and Chuck
solved the problem (dirty carpets and bare feet) by washing their feet as they entered.

> *got up from supper and *laid His outer garments aside; and He took a towel and tied it around Himself.

Chuck reiterates that the church is for everyone and they should invite their friends.

> I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.

> Everyone everywhere deserves the life in Jesus

> But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our wrongdoings, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),

There is no sin too great. Chuck has baptism at the beach for those that want to come.

> Therefore if anyone is in Christ, this person is a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.

Jennette's faith is renewed after seeing how much her father has changed and what has happened.

Don't give up on Jesus because you met bad counterfiets.
