This is my take on the key points. My notetaking is not all that great so it's possible I may have missed something. This is not going to be
very wordy either but my hopes is that I will get better at writing these posts and expressing what I mean better. So, if there's something
you don't like, I'm sorry, it's what it is. I will get better over time.

The navy calling Maverick back is similar to God's calling for your life. His desire to live for something greater.

Your assignment may not be what you think it is. You are called to _teach_.

> Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.

> But encourage one another every day, as long as it is still called "today," so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

This is a high stakes mission, there is a lot on the line. For us, it is a matter of eternal life or eternal death.

> And he said, 'Then I request of you, father, that you send him to my father’s house—for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, so that they will not come to this place of torment as well.'

Maverick is having problems with teaching the pilots what they need to know to succeed.

You will face difficulties. Look to the men &amp; women that have come before you and use their wisdom to guide you.

> This is what the Lord says: Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, Where the good way is, and walk in it; Then you will find a resting place for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'

Then Iceman tells Maverick, typing it out on the computer, "It's time to let go".

Let go of what is holding you back and keeping you from doing what you are being called to do.

The...

* Recruits
* Students
* Neighbor
* Church

...needs you.

> in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,

Maverick doubting his abilities...

If you are doubting what God has called you to do, remember: "It's all about the pilot in the box"

If God Called you to then nothing can stop you but that does not mean you will not get obstacles in the way.

> Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.
