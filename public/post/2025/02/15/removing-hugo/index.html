<main>
<p>Absolutely nothing against Hugo, in fact I <em>love</em> Hugo as a blog framework. I found myself focused too much on having the right look and meddling with themes
that I was not producing any posts.</p>
<p>This one will be short, I am not a wordy person. I just wanted to get my thoughts down while they were on my mind.</p>
<p>I will return to Hugo at some point or maybe something better than Hugo will have come around by the time I am ready to return. In the meantime,
I will focus on creating posts within this repository.</p>
